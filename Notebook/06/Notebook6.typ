= Summary
- Analyzes whether meaning is implicit within the message or requires external context to understand.
- Discusses the various ways in which information can be "pulled out" of a message.
- Explores meaning in the context of genotypes and phenotypes.
- Lays out the three layers of any message: frame, outer, and inner.
- Claims meaning in intrinsic if intelligence is universal.

= Dialogue $arrow.l.r.long$ Chapter Link
In the dialogue we see Achilles partially eat his fortune from his fortune cookie.
The remaining bit of the haiku is interpreted in two different ways suggesting that the meaning of the message was not inherit to the message itself.
Although both are intelligent beings, they were able to get two different (yet plausible) meanings from the same message.
Similarly, the Tortoise describes Mr. Crabs jukebox which contains just one record but multiple phonographs which play it differently.
While the same message was recorded on the record the phonographs were able to play it different by scaling up the semitones between the notes.
This suggests that the interpreter has more power over the meaning of the message than the message itself.

= Questions
*Q1:* Is meaning inherit to the message or is it required to have a "player" to extract the meaning? \
*Q2:* What properties make the frame message recognizable to a sufficiently intelligent being? (pg. 167) \
*Q3:* Does all the information to build the phenotype reside in the DNA? Could you reconstruct the chemical context? (pg. 175-6)

*Passage 1 (pg. 164)*
#v(-1em)
#quote()[
  We do not know enough about the nature of intelligence, emotions, or music to say whether the inner logic of a piece by Bach is so universally compelling that its meaning could span galaxies.
  However, whether Bach in particular has enough inner logic is not the issue here; the issue is whether _any_ message has, per se, enough compelling inner logic that its context will be restored automatically whenever intelligence of a high enough level comes in contact with it.

This gets into the core of the chapter.
In order to say to say if a message has enough inner logic to it, we would have to know a lot more about the nature of intelligence and everything downstream of that.
We could conclude that if what we know as intelligence is in fact a universal pattern, then messages would have inherit meaning to them.

*Passage 2 (pg. 170)*
#v(-1em)
#quote()[
  ...our intelligence is not disembodied , but is instantiated in physical objects: our brains.
  ..._our brains run without being told how to run_.
  So it is at the level where thoughts are produced by physical law that Carroll's rule-paradox breaks down...

#v(-0.8em)
This seems to solve the problem of the infinite towers of messages one would need to understand any given message.
In some sense, our physical brains are the base case to the paradox.
This makes a compelling argument that meaning could be intrinsic considering at some level we don't need messages to understand some message.

= Key Terms / Mappings
- *Semitone:* The smallest interval used in classical Western music, equal to a twelfth of an octave.
- *Epigenesis:* The process of going from a genotype to a phenotype, in biology.
- *Exotic Isomorphism:* Isomorphism in which the parts mapping to each other are not obvious.
- *Prosaic Isomorphism:* Isomorphism in which the parts mapping to each other are obvious.
- *Aleatoric:* Random.
- *Chauvinism*: An unreasonable belief in the superiority of one's own group, often manifesting as excessive patriotism.

= Counter Case or Limitation
There are various interstellar radio messages that seem like they would fit in this chapter.
They all occurred during or after the writing of this book but the idea of sending out some coded message into the universe in the hopes that some intelligent life will pick it up and decipher it is thematic of this chapter.

= Study Card Sentence
Meaning is intrinsic if intelligence is natural.

= Muddiest Point
The jukebox analogy lost many at many points. Also what is meant by triggers?
