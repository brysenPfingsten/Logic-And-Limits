# Canon by Intervallic Augmentation
- Tortoise and Achilles at Chinese Restaurant
- Haiku: 5, 7, 5 syllables
  - "One war two ear ewe"
  - "O new art woe are we"
    - Meta on a new kind of poem
- Jukebox which has one record but multiple phonographs that play it differently
  - BACH -> CAGE
  - Round(n * 10/3)
- Fortune cookie as a message
- Does the message or the interpreter have more information?

# Ch VI: The Location of Meaning
### When Is One Thing Not Always the Same?
- Is meaning localized and universal or not?
  - Interaction of a mind or mechanism?

### Information-Bearers and Information-Revealers
- There are pieces of information that can be "pulled out"
  - Those that can't as well

### Genotypes and Phenotypes
- *Genotype*: molecule of DNA
- *Phenotype*: biological construction
- *Epigenesis*: Genotype -> Phenotype
- Instructions are coded in the DNA

### Exotic and Prosaic Isomorphisms
- *Exotic*: Hard to divide into parts
- *Prosaic*: easy to divide into parts mapping to each other
  - Records and their players
  - Gplot and its butterflies
- Genetics is very hard because phenotypical features arise from many discontinuous chunks

### Jukeboxes and Triggers
- DNA is like a song that tells you how to make a more complicated jukebox
- Certain triggers cause things to be built
- The record and its player can be separated, interchanged, and matched against each other

### DNA and the Necessity of Chemical Context
- The DNA relies on cellular chemical processes taking place but does not code for them.
- Do you need the chemical context or just intelligence?

### An Unlikely UFO
- If aliens got a record, they would know it bore information

### Levels of Understanding of a Message
- It's not enough to just make the sounds
  - It also must trigger similar emotions
    - What if they don't have emotions like us?

### "Imaginary Spaceship"
- Aleatoric: Depending on the throw of a dice; random
  - Music where the structure is chosen by random processes.
- Would the message of this piece be reconstructable? Probably not
- We don't know enough about the nature of intelligence to say if the inner logic of Bach is universally compelling.

### The Heroic Deciphers
- Decoding mechanisms do NOT add meaning, just reveal it
- Meaning is part of an object to the extent that it acts upon intelligence in a predictable way.

### Three Layers of Any Message
1. Frame: "I am a message. Decode me!"
  - Recognize the need for a decoding machine
2. Outer: The implicit information that tells you how to decode the inner message
  - to understand the outer is to know how to build a correct decoding mechanism for the inner message
3. Inner: The message that is supposed to be transmitted
  - Extract the meaning intended by the sender
- Works of art are trying to convey their style more than anything else.

### Schrodinger's Aperiodic Crystals
- Aperiodic Crystal + Regular geometric structure = message

### Languages for the Three Levels
- Outer message cannot be in the explicit language. Contradiction

### The "Jukebox" Theory of Meaning
- No message contains inherit meaning because before it could be understood it is the input to some jukebox which will be added to the message?
  - Before you understand a message, you have to have a message that tells you how to understand the message

### Against the Jukebox Theory
- Our brains are physical entities that run w/o being told how
  - They are the base case to the recursion

### *Meaning Is Intrinsic If Intelligence is Natural*

### Earth Chauvinism
- *Chauvinism*: an unreasonable belief in the superiority of one's own group, often manifesting as excessive patriotism.
- It's hard to imagine other types of intelligence
  - We could ground it as human intelligence to make meaning intrinsic

### Two Plaques in Space
- Dots representing fib
- (1, 1) = gentotype but not enough information to derive the phenotype
- If you include more than you have a long genotype
  - Mechanism of genotype -> phenotype can be inferred 

### Bach vs. Cage Again
- CAGE = Composition of Aleatorically Generated Elements
- BACH = Beautiful Aperiodic Crystal of Harmony
- Intelligence loves patterns

### How Universal is DNA's Message
- How much of the content necessary for its own understanding is a message capable of restoring?
