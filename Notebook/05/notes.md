# Little Harmonic Labyrinth
- Tortoise and Achilles are on Coney Island when they get kidnapped and brought onto a sky hideaway
  - Reading into a book where they're in Achilles Home
    - Swallow pushing potion to go to the Convex and Concave
    - Achilles saying "I wish my wish would not be granted" sends them to Tubolia
    - The pop out in Reptiles by Escher
      - Go down one story into Evil Majotaur's Little Harmonic Labyrinth
    - Eat popcorn and back to Reptiles
  - Move perpendicular back to Tortoise's Home

- GOD = GOD over Djinn
- Djinn = (meta)* genies

# Chapter V: Recursive Structures and Processes
### Pushing, Popping, and Stacks
- *Push* = Suspend current task
- *Pop* = Close current task and resume other tasks
- Stack stores the where/who and what

### Stacks in Music
- Modulation pushes another key onto the stack
- We don't have reliable deep stacks
  - We can get lost in quick key changes

### Recursion in Language
- Every language has stacks
- Germans put their verbs at the end?

### Recursive Transition Networks
- Diagram showing various paths which can be followed to accomplish a task
- Won't hit an infinite regress if you have a non-recursive path

### "Bottoming Out" and Heterarchies
- Indirect recursion / Mutually recursive
- Heterarchy: An organizational system where elements are unranked, equal in authority, or ranked in multiple, flexible ways, rather than in a strict, top-down, vertical, or pyramid hierarchy

### A Chaotic Sequence
- Q function tells you how far to go back

### Two Striking Recursive Graphs
- INT
  - Interchange
  - Acts on continued fractions by flipping signs
    - *Continued Fraction*: Denominator contains a sum involving another fraction
  - It is its own inverse
  - x is rational -> Int(x) is rational, same with quadratic
- Gplot
  - "What are the allowed energies of electrons in a crystal in a magnetic field"
- Both constructed from a "skeleton" laid onto itself infinitely many times

### Recursion at the Lowest Level of Matter
- *Bare particles*: Theoretical particle without interactions
- *Renormalized*: turning them back on
- Virtual Photons
- Must take the average of all possible paths

### Copies and Sameness
- Canons, Gplot, Fish and Scales, Butterflies
- All have copies of themselves distorted in some way
- There is an "isomorphism" here
- When are two things the same?

### Programming and Recursion: Modularity, Loops, Procedures
- Bounded v.s. Free Loops
- *Hofstadter's Law*: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
