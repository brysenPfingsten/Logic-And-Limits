# Two-Part Invention
- Achilles caught the tortoise
  - "solvitur ambulando" = It is solved by walking
  - Distance was diminishing the whole time
- From Euclid's Treatise
  - A) Things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other
  - B) The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to same thing
  - Z) The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other
  - AAA Syllogism
  - You can deny the propositions or soundness of the argument. If you deny the soundness, add another proposition called C: If A and B are true, then so is Z. If you deny that then add a proposition D: If A, B, and C are true, then so is Z. Continues ad infinitum

# Chapter II: Meaning and Form in Mathematics
- Previous dialog was similar to Bach's Ever Rising Canon
> [!NOTE]
> Do words and thoughts follow formal rules or not?

### The pq System
- 3 Symbols: p q -
- xp-qx is an axiom when x is only hyphens (axiom schema)
- Rule: Let x, y, z = -* and xpyqz be a know theorem, then xpy-qz- is a theorem

### The Decision Procedure
- First two hyphen groups lengths add up to the third
- Proof is like induction / hereditary
  - Axiom is true
  - Production rule maintains the invariant and no non theorem becomes a theorem
- Any theorem with only lengthening has a decision procedure
  - Structural Recursion basically
  - Can't get shorter and shorter relates to the dialog

### Bottom-Up v.s. Top-Down
- Top-Down = Previous
- Bottom-Up = BFS

### Isomorphisms Induce Meaning
- -p--q--- is a statement? 1 + 2 = 3
- Two complex structures mapped onto each other such that there are corresponding (similar roles) parts
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Perception of Isomorphisms creates meaning in people's minds
> p <-> plus, q <-> equal, - <-> one, -- <-> two, etc
- Interpretation: symbol word correspondence
- correspondence between true statements and interpreted theorems

### Meaningless and Meaningful Interpretations
- To be meaningful, must map theorems to reality

### Active v.s. Passive Meanings
- If there is a meaningful Isomorphism in a formal system, we are forced to recognize it
- With language, once we have learned the meaning of a word, we can make new statements based on meaning. ACTIVE
- In formal systems you can read but not make new theorems. PASSIVE

### Double Entendre
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When different aspects of reality are isomorphic to each other a single formal system can be isomorphic to both
- Example: pq system and addition/subtraction

### Formal Systems and Reality
- Can all of reality be turned into a formal system?
  - Does the universe operate deterministically? What about quantum mechanics?

### Mathematics and Symbol Manipulation
### The Basic Laws of Arithmetic
- If you don't see some things, a proof won't help
- Counting is unordered -> commutativity and associativity
- Abstraction of a number does not equal real world observations always

### Ideal Numbers
- Numbers as realities misbehave
- Can numbers be captured in a formal system

### Euclid's Proof of Infinite Priming
- Consider N!, \[1, N\] does not divide N. Therefore N is either prime or divisible by some larger prime.

### Getting Around Infinity
- How to handle infinite collections of facts using finite language and reasoning?
- For my, for all, etc
- We don't understand what _all_ means, we just know the rules for using it
- If reasoning follows rules, then we can write them down.
- Proofs are constructed from many non continuous jumps
