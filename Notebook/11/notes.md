# ... Ant Fugue
- Continuation of previous dialog
- Achilles: "Mu"
- Crab: "Holism"
- Anteater: "Reductionism"
- M spells HOLISM x3 out of Reductionism
- U spells REDUCTIONISM out of Holism
- MU is hidden as well as Hofstadter
- *Holism*: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts
- *Reductionism*: a whole can be understood completely if you under its parts and the nature of their sum
- Tortoise: "Mu" is like a fugue
- Aunt Hillary (ant hill)
    - Anteater is somehow chill with the colony
- *Stretto*: One theme repeatedly enters in one voice after another with little delay
- Ants individually are dumb but smart as a whole
    - Like neurons and the brain
    - Each acts individually, but there are collective movements
    - Acts can fizzle out or reach a critical mass

- Different castes of an ant colony
    - Males: do nothing
    - Soldiers: Big heads, strong jaws, not actually good fighters
    - Workers: Specialize and change as they age
- Motion in the colony updates the caste distribution
- Having something productive to do results in a critical mass of ants
- Signals transport specialized ants to relevant bits of the colony
    - Moves somewhere then decomposes
- The signal moves as long as the local needs are different from what it can supply
- Evolution forced the caste distribution so it is meaningless?
- *Teleology*: The explanation of phenomena in terms of the purpose they serve rather than of the cause by which they arise
    - Meaning of caste distribution
    - Purposefulness of signals
- Ant Fugue by Escher
- Symbols are teams of a sufficiently high level
    - Symbols:Signals::Words:Letters
- The highest level description carries the most explanatory powers even though it leaves out individual ants
    - Medium but not the message
    - Like trying to describe a book in terms of letters
- The whole colony is the "agent"
- Conscious Systems only see themselves on the symbol level
    - The bottom levels don't have information (?)
- Four voice fugue like how there are four letters in the starting figure
- *Fermata*: Slow down or stay on a single note
- *Organ Point*: Sustaining of a single note by one of the voices (often the lowest)
    - G: "Gee!"
    - "How is it possible that" (pg 314)?
- Aunt Hillary gets antsy thinking about ants
    - Libertarian as a whole, communist on a low level
- JSBmat ferACH
- Former owner = Johant Sebestiant Fermant
    - Mathematiciant 
    - Musiciant
    - Rain => Disorganized => Aunt Hillary
- Fourmi's Well-Tested Conjecture
    - $n^a + n^b = n^c$
    - Fugue
- Fermant's Last Fugue

# Ch XI :: Brains and Thoughts
### New Perspectives on Thought
- Trying to simulate thinking on computers came up short but still taught us some things about what thought is and is not

### Intensionality and Extensionality
> "Thoughts must depend on representing reality in the hardware of the brain"
- The brain consists of _active_ symbols
    - Rules and symbols are mixed
- The same thing can be expressed in different ways
    - E.g., 50 in TNT, people
- The Calculus of description
    - Intensional: Not tied down

### The Brain's "Ants"
- Neurons
    - Synapses (entry point)
    - 1 Axon (output channel)
    - Moves ions
    - Cell body makes a decision to fire or not based on a threshold
        - "I think therefore I sum"
- Up to 200,000 entry points to a neuron
- Bifurcation splits the output signal

### Larger Structures in the Brain
- There is not a fixed group of neurons for each different concept
- Not really know how they carry out their functions

### Mappings between Brains
- Earthworms have isomorphic brains
- Why do we think differently?
- Where is knowledge and thoughts located

### Localization of Brain Processes: An Enigma
- Remove parts of a rat's brain to see where memory lies
    - Couldn't find it
- Other experiments found localization that could be triggered

### Specificity in Visual Processing
- Found neural pathways from retina -> visual cortex in cats
- Somewhere there is an isomorphism from 2D and 3D

### A "Grandmother Cell"?
- Visual processing for cat, monkey, human
    - Visual cortex at the back
        - 3 Subregions: 17, 18, 19
            - Columnar
- The more intelligent the species, the longer cortical processing

### Funneling into Neural Modules
- Dozen or so neurons fire and funnel up?
- Visual "signatures"
    - How can we recognize an object after not seeing it
        - Crystallizing

### Modules Which Mediate Thought Processes
- If we could find where and the nature of "neural complexes" which map to concepts, it would be like finding the symbol level

### Active Symbols
- Can be dormant or active/awake
- Variable entities
- When awakened, they send out a message
    - We have "sealed them off from neurons"
    - Better because they now correspond to something
- Are there symbols for varying degrees of things?
- What is the "size" of a symbol?
    - Maybe about the size of a word

### Classes and Instances
### The Prototype Principal
> "The most specific event can serve as a general example of a class of events"
- Are symbols classes or instances?
    - Probably both

### The Splitting-off of Instances From Classes
- Instance inherit properties from their class
    - Has default values that can change
    - Can become a class of its own one day
        - E.g., actual child, football player

### The Difficulty of Disentangling Symbols From Each Other
- Once one can be activated independently it is separated?
- Things responsible for various degrees of specificity
    1. Various on activation of class node
    2. Coordinated simultaneous activation of multiple class signals
    3. Single instance symbol
    4. Single instance and multiple classes
    5. Several instances and several classes
- Impossible to enumerate all symbols, especially once you start permuting them

### Symbols --- Software or Hardware?
- Do neurons represent an arbitrary amount of symbols

### Liftability of Intelligence
- If we can have a high level of understanding of intelligence, we can lift it to other hardware
    - Intelligence = Software
- Where does intelligence reside?

### Can One Symbol Be Isolated?
- Things can be intertwined but distinct
- Even if they could, they couldn't be activated in isolation

### The Symbols of Insects
- They can't generalize or hypothesize
- Wasp will loop if you move the cricket

### Class Symbols and Imaginary Worlds
- We can construct artificial worlds from classes and description

### Intuitive Laws of Physics

### Procedural and Declarative Knowledge
- *Declarative*: Stored explicitly (facts)
- *Procedural*: Encoded as programs (spread around)
- If melodies were stored declaratively, we could memorize them equally as easily

### Visual Imagery
- Block motor activity when visualizing
- Somethings are assembled and not retrieved
