# A Mu Offering
- A&T watched a lecture on the Genetic Code
- Achilles dreamed he and the Tortoise were his own DNA
- DNA codes for Amino Acids which in turn manipulate DNA
- "yen for yin and yang"
- Okanisama = 7th Patriarch
    - Reality is one and immutable
- You approach Zen through some method which you later discard
- Kōan: story about zen masters and their students 
    - "Does a dog have a Buddha-nature?"
        - "MU"
            - Unasking the question
- Decision procedure for kōans
    - Translate the kōan into a string and see if it has Buddha nature
        1. Transcribing: phonetic alphabet with only 4 symbols
        2. Translation: Rub together with ribo. The symbols tell you how to fold it.
- ME vs EYE
- Central Dogma of Zen Strings: Do not go backwards
- Self evident positions, string manipulation
- Infinite number of kōan. How do you know there isn't a string you can't make?
- Law of Double Nodulation

# Chapter IX: Mumon and Gödel
### What is Zen?
- Impossible to characterize but stories can help
- Intellectual quicksand

### Zen Master Mumon
- Wrote "The Gateless Gate" (Mumonkan)
    - 48 kōans, commentaries, and poems
- Nonsensical
- Trying to break the mind of logic
- What is so bad about logic and why do you need to get rid of it to achieve enlightenment?

### Zen's Struggle Against Dualism
- *Enlightenment*: Transcending Dualism
- *Dualism*: Conceptual division of the world into categories
    - Perceptual and conceptual
- Words are inherently dualistic and Zen does not want to rely on them
- Once you perceive an object, it is separated from the rest
- Words contain truth (but not all) and falsehoods
- The road to truth may bristle with paradox

### Ism, The Un-Mode, and Unmon
- *Ism*: Antiphilosophy, being without thinking
- *Holism*: Can only understand things as their whole
    - Zen says the world cannot be divided into parts

### Zen and Tumbolia
- There is something about of Zen that Zen cannot attain
- Zen can't be it's own metasystem

### Escher and Zen
Escher also captures nonlogic and non realities

### Hemiolia and Escher
- Hemiolia: 2 groups of 3 beats played in the same time as 3 groups of 2 beats

### Indra's Net
- Huh?

### Mumon on MU
- MU isn't nothingness but it is similar?

### From Mumon to the MU-Puzzle
- Has MU theorem nature? ==> NO

### Mumon Shows Us How to Solve the MU-Puzzle
1. The I-count begins at 1.
2. 2 rules don't affect it
3. The other two can't make a multiple of three unless given one 

### Gödel-Numbering the MU-System
- M <=> 3
- I <=> 1
- U <=> 0

### Seeing Things Both Typographically and Arithmetically
1. $10m + 1 --> 10 x (10m + 1)$
2. $3 x 10^m + n --> 10^m x (3 x 10^m + n) + n$
3. $k + 10^(m+3) + 111 x 10^m + n --> k x 10^(m+1) + n$
4. $k x 10^(m+2) + n --> k x 10^m + n$
- Axiom: 31
- Central Proposition: Typographical rules for manipulating numerals are actually arithmetic rules for operating on numbers
    - You can transfer the study of all formal systems into number theory

### MIU Producible Strings
- MIU-Numbers are recursively enumerable
- The harder question is if its complement is r.e.

### Answering Questions about Producible Numbers by Consulting TNT
- Can translate is MU a theorem of the MIU-System into TNT
    - Is 30 a MIU-Number
    - Monstrous string, let's call it Mumon

### The Dual Nature of MUMON
- Is MUMON a theorem of TNT?
1. 30 is a MIU-Number
2. Mu is a theorem of the MIU-Systems

1. Statement can be coded into number theory
2. Statements about number theory can be translated into TNT

### Codes and Implicit Meaning
- Messages about the MIU system are written in strings of TNT

### The Boomerang: Gödel-Numbering TNT

| Symbol | Codon | Mnemonic Justification |
|--------|-------|------------------------|
| 0 | 666 | Number of the Beast for the Mysterious Zero |
| S | 123 | successorship: 1, 2, 3, |
| = | 111 | visual resemblance, turned sideways |
| + | 112 | 1+1=2 |
| • | 236 | 2x3=6 |
| ( | 362 | ends in 2 * |
| ) | 323 | ends in 3 * |
| < | 212 | ends in 2 * these three pairs |
| > | 213 | ends in 3 * form a pattern |
| [ | 312 | ends in 2 * |
| ] | 313 | ends in 3 * |
| a | 262 | opposite to V (626) |
| ' | 163 | 163 is prime |
| ∧ | 161 | ´a´ is a "graph" of the sequence 1-6-1 |
| ∨ | 616 | ´v' is a "graph" of the sequence 6-1-6 |
| ⊃ | 633 | 6 "implies" 3 and 3, in some sense . |
| \~ | 223 | 2 + 2 is not 3 |
| ∃ | 333 | ` looks like `3' |
| ∀ | 626 | opposite to a; also a "graph" of 6-2-6 |
| : | 636 | two dots, two sixes |
| punc. | 611 | special number, as on Bell system (411, 911) |

- You don't need to look for arithmetic rules because the rules are already arithmetic!

### TNT-Numbers: A Recursively-Enumerable Set of Numbers
- a is not a TNT number
- Replace a with 123,666,111,666 aka S0 = 0
    - 123,666,111,666 is not a TNT-Number
    - S0=0 is not a theorem of TNT

### TNT Tries to Swallow Itself
- *Central Dogma of Mathematical Logic*: "It is in the nature of any formalization of number theory that its metalanguage is embedded within it"
- TNT => N => meta-TNT

### G: A String Which Talks About Itself in Code
- "G is not a theorem of TNT"

### G's Existence is What Cause's TNT's Incompleteness
- Is G a theorem of TNT or not?
- We found a string which expresses a true statement but is not a theorem
- Tortoise's string was analogous to ~G
