# Contracrostipunctus 
- Achilles is visiting the Tortoise
- *Acrostic*: A poem, word puzzle, or other composition in which certain letters in each line form a word or words.
- *Contrapunctus*: The individual movements or fugues within Bach's monumental, unfinished work, The Art of Fugue
- *Prevaricator*: Liar through distorted language
- Each part of the dialog spells out "hofstdter's contracrostipunctus acrostically backwards spells j.s. bach"
  - Backs, this is an acrostic for "JSBACH"
- Every record player has a record it cannot play

# Chapter IV: Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry
### Implicit and Explicit Meaning
- The more complex an isomorphism is, the more equipment is required to extract meaning form it.
- Language is an "isomorphism"
- If an isomorphism is very simple, we see the meaning without the isomorphism
  - Language
  - Noise from a collision

### Explicit Meaning of the Contracrostipunctus
- Most explicit = The story and its events
- Records and Record Players
  - 2 Meanings for the grooves
    1. Music: Sound in the air
    2. Sequence of vibrations induced in the record player
      - Groove patterns are isomorphic to air vibrations
      - Air vibrations are isomorphic to phonograph vibrations
- Goblet is similar
  - Letters are isomorphic to music notes => Transcription
  - Music notes are isomorphic Musical sounds => Translation

### Implicit Meaning of Contracrostipunctus
- The first half is isomorphic to the second half
- Phonograph -> Violin
- Tortoise -> Achilles
- Crab -> Tortoise
- Grooves -> Autograph
- Level 1: Goblets and record which backfire
- Level 2: Tortoise method of exploiting implicit meaning
- Its own structure is isomorphic to the events it portrays

### Mapping Between the Contracrostipunctus and Godel's Theorem
- Phonograph <=> Axiomatic System for Number Theory
- Low-fidelity Phonograph <=> "Weak" Axiomatic System
- High-fidelity Phonograph <=> "Strong" Axiomatic System
- "Perfect" Phonograph <=> Complete System for Number Theory
- "Blueprint" of Phonograph <=> Axioms and rules of formal systems
- Record <=> String of the formal system
- Playable Record <=> Theorem of the Axiomatic System
- Unplayable Record <=> Nontheorem of the Axiomatic System
- Sound <=> True statement in Number Theory
- Reproducible Sound <=> Interpreted Theorem of the System
- Unreproducible Sound <=> True statement which isn't a theorem
- Song Title <=> Implicit Meaning of Godel's String
- Quarendo Invenietis = Seek and you shall find

### The Art of the Fugue
- Bach died before he could finish
- did he die because of his self-reference?

### Problems Caused by Godel's Result
- Real problem is what we except from formal systems
- Truth transcends theoremhood

### The Modified pq-system and Inconsistency
- Axiom Schema 2: xp-qx
  - Now inconsistent with reality
  - Contradictions within the system as well

### Regaining Consistency
- Interpret q as >=

### The History of Euclidean Geometry
- Euclid uses plain language in his Elements rather than math notation
- Our association with a word > it's definition
- First 4 postulates are elegant:
  1. There is a straight line between two points
  2. A straight line can be extended infinitely in both directions
  3. You can draw a circle with a line as it's radius and a point at it's center
  4. All right angles are congruent
- The last (parallel postulate) is not

### The Many Faces of Noneuclid
- Girolamo Succheri tried to prove the 5th postulate by contradiction
  - Found a proposition "repugnant to the nature of a straight line"
  - Really discovered hyperbolic geometry
- Took this man's soul away

### Undefined Terms
- Deny the fifth postulate and discover new geometries
- Defined implicitly by the totality of the propositions

### The Possibility of Multiple Integrations
- Consistency is not a property of a formal system per se, but depends on the interpretation which is proposed for it

### Variates of Consistency
- Consistency: every theorem when interpreted is true
- Internal Consistency: No two statements disagree with each other

### Hypothetical Worlds and Consistency
- Logically, physically, mathematically, ...
- Border between interesting and uninteresting is between physics and math

### Layers of Stability in Visual Perception
- With Escher, you can see a crazy world or a bunch of lines
- We can't make it make sense in our world

### Is Mathematics the Same in Every Conceivable World?
- If we require math to be consistent, non-Euclidean geometry isn't valid
- Just logic? Zen rejects this.

### Is Number Theory the Same in All Conceivable Worlds?
- Core of number theory = Peano Arithmetic

### Completeness
- Every true statement is produced by the system
- Well formed strings which express true statements but aren't theorems

### How an Interpretation May Make or Break Consistency
1. Make new rules
2. Tighten the interpretation
