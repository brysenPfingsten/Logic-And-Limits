# Sonata for Unaccompanied Achilles
- *Torticollis*: Condition that causes the head to tilt and turn to one side.
- *Phantasmagorical*: Imagery that is fantastic, dreamlike, surreal, and constantly shifting.
- On call with Tortoise
  - Sees strange beasts?
  - Fiddle v.s. guitar
  - Unaccompanied violin composition by Bach
  - Words with ADAC consecutively inside it
    - Riddle from the snail(?)
  - Word that start with HE and ends with HE
  - Mosaic II
- What is the tortoise saying
  - Reddit thread from 14 years ago asked if there was a computer program that could fill it in.
  - Pg. 200 has some of the missing lines
- Figure is represented by Achilles' sentences and ground by Tortoise's
- Tortoise in the picture has a Torticollis as well 
  - Strange loop!
- Mirrors

# Chapter III: Figure and Ground
### Primes vs. Composites
- Can we make a formal system for primes?
- Typographic Operations
  1. Read/recognize symbols from a finite set
  2. Write down any symbol in that set
  3. Copy and Paste
  4. Delete
  5. Equality Comparison
  6. Store a list and read from it

### The tq-System
- Axiom Schema: xt-qx where x is a hyphen string
- Rule of Inference: xtyqz => xty-qzx

### Capturing Compositeness
- x-ty-qz => Cz
  - z is composite because it is the product of numbers greater than 1.
- Requirement of Formality keeps you from mixing up arithmetical facts with typographical theorems

### Illegally Characterizing Primes
- Proposed Rule: If Cx is not a theorem, then Px is
  - Problem is that it's not explicitly typographical
  - Requires reasoning outside of the system
- Cx contains theorems and nontheorems
  - Do all nontheorems have a common form?
  - The theorems "do" b/c they originate from a common set of rules
  - The holes are _negatively_ defined

### Figure and Ground
- Figure = Positive Space
- Ground = Background/Negative Space
- MAIL BOX
- Can you create a drawing with words in both figure and ground?
- *Cursively Drawable*: Ground is an accident
- *Recursive Figure*: Ground is a figure on its own
  - Ground and figure are cursively drawn (twice cursive)
- There exists recognizable whose negative space is not any recognizable form
  - There exists cursively drawable figures which are not recursive
- *Paragon*: A person or thing regarded as a perfect example of a particular quality
- FIGURE-FIGURE
- With the (to be developed) Typographical Number Theory (TNT) it would be nice if all false statements could be categorized as
  1. Negative Space of all TNT Theorems
    - But some truths are found in nontheorems
  2. Altered copies (negations of each TNT Theorem)
    - But outside the set of negated theorems are found some falsehoods

### Figure and Ground in Music
- Melody and Accompaniment
- Bach and Baroque musicians had "recursive pieces"
- On beat and off beat
  - Two notes at once or on the number and the "and"

### Recursively Enumerable Sets vs. Recursive Sets
- Is there a way to represent primes, however complicated, as positive space? YES
- There exist formal systems whose negative space (non-theorems) is not the positive space (set of theorems) of any formal system
  - Similar to Godel's Theorem
  - There exists recursively enumerable sets which are not recursive
    - Recursively enumerable = generated by typographical rules
    - There are problems where you can recognize correct answers when you see them, but there is no algorithm that always decides correctly in finite time.
    - In other words:
      - You can confirm membership if the answer is “yes”
      - But you cannot always determine non-membership
      - And there is no total algorithm that settles every case
- There exist formal systems for which there is no typographical decision procedure
- If items were enumerated in increasing order, you could characterize the Ground
- 1, 3, 7, 12, 18, 26, 35, 45, 56, 69, ...
- R(1) = 1 and S(1) = 2
- For n > 1:
  - R(n) = R(n - 1) + S(n - 1)
  - S = Increasing list of positive integers not appearing in R
- How is this sequence like FIGURE-FIGURE?
  - It is mutually defining
  - Both sets are the "figure"

### Primes as Figure Rather than Ground
- Goal is to represent non-divisibility
- Axiom Schema: xyDNDx where x and y are hyphen strings
  - No number larger than x divides x
- Rule: xDNDy => xDNDxy
  - If x does not divide y, then x also does not divide x + y
- We would like to say "the number Z is divisor-free up to X"
- Rule: --DNDz => zDF--
  - If 2 does not divide z, then z is a divisor free wrt 2
- Rule: zDFx ^ x-DNDz => zDFx-
  - If z is divisor free up to x and x + 1 does not divide z then z is divisor free up to x + 1
- Now for Primes
- Rule: z-DFz => Pz-
  - If z has no divisors from 2 up to z, then z + 1 is prime
- Axiom: P--
  - 2 is prime
- Primality is decidable because checking divisibility is a one-way, monotonic process: you test larger and larger divisors, never revising earlier results, and the procedure always finishes. That lack of backtracking or feedback lets a formal system capture primality cleanly. By contrast, Gödel’s theorem, the halting problem, and the gap between recursively enumerable and recursive sets arise when formal systems allow back-and-forth interference, self-reference, or looping, which destroys monotonicity and prevents guaranteed termination.
