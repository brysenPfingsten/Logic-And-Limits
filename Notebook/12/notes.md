# English French German Suite
- Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll
    - Knight slays the beast
- Even though it is nonsense, it can be translated

# Ch XII :: Minds and Thought
### Can Minds Be Mapped onto Each Other?
- Neurons too low-level, suborgans not useful
- Isomorphism between symbols and triggers
    - Functional isomorphism
- Some people think more alike than others
- Partial Software Isomorphism
    - Repertoire of symbols
    - Triggering patterns of symbols

### Comparing Different Semantic Networks
- Falls short because:
    - Too complex
    - Can't represent "nearness" or causality
    - Binary
- Local and global properties

### Translation of "Jabberwocky"
- How to find "the same node" in different networks
- How to evoke the same feeling in the readers
- Very hard task to translate but possible because of a rough isomorphism between brains

### ASU's
- Alternative Structure of the Union
- Try to reconstruct a map of the USA from memory
    - Certain parts will be faithful, others will not

### A Surprise Reversal
- Now you go into this world but with a map of the USA

### Centrality and Universality
- Centrality: Most important cities and routes can be mapped onto each other
- You can use common reference points to navigate 2 ASU's
- What is the invariant core of human intelligence?
- We tend to ignore how much overlap there really is between humans
- Sometimes somebody is missing a "Chicago"
- Sometimes they share your same niche

### How Much Do Language and Culture Channel Thought?
- Fluent speakers use words at their regular frequency
- Culture and subcultures affect thought
- Symbols are still largely the same

### Trips and Itineraries in ASU's
- Thought <-> Trip
- Symbols <-> Towns
- A common enough trip would be synthesized into its own town
- Thoughts are not arbitrary and endless

### Possible, Potential, and Preposterous Pathways
- *Potential*: Only if special external circumstances arose
- *Aberrant*: Not conforming to an expected or usual standard
    - Possible, make sense locally but not globally

### Different Styles of Translating Novels
- How to translate "S. Pereulok" from Crime and Punishment?
    - S. Lane : No
    - s. Place : Sure
    - Stoliarny Place : Yeah
    - Carpenter's Lane : Ew
        - Too english
- What about idioms
    - Too literal = Strange
    - Too loose = Campbell's Soup

### High-Level Comparisons between Programs
- How to compare 2 computer programs trying to do the same task?
    - Need to abstract and chunk them into "etherware"
- Memory dumps

### High-Level Comparisons Between Brains
- Can brains be read on a similarly high level?
- We can do it with our own brains, what about a "neuroneater"

### Potential Beliefs, Potential Symbols
- There is no information in the brain state itself which tells which route will be chosen
    - External circumstances play a large role
- Brain state can provide a conditional description
    - Probabilistic

### Where is the Sense of Self?
- Soulist would say is immaterial
- Consciousness is that property of a system that arises whenever there exists symbols which obey triggering patterns

### Subsystems
- "I" or "the self" is another symbol
- Subsystem = Constellation of symbols

### Subsystems and Shared Code
- Many symbols can be borrowed and/or modified when trying to load someone else's "self"

### The Self-Symbol and Consciousness
- Can play the role of the "soul"
    - Communicating with the rest of the subsystems
    - Symbols for mental activity (meta-symbols)
- Self symbol is necessary?

### Our First Encounter with Lucas
- If a conscious being says they know something, then they (know that they)* know it
- Can reflect and criticize itself w/o becoming a new thing or adding something else
- Above a certain level of complexity, a qualitative difference appears
- *Eo Ipso*: by that very act or quality; thereby
- Once a machine begins acting in a nondeterministic and nonprogrammed way, it is no longer a machine but a mind
