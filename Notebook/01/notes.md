# Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering
### Back
- Liked by Frederick the Great
- Excellent organ player

### Canons and Fugues
- Canon = One theme playing against itself
  - Needs to be written such that each note serves multiple roles
  - Diminution = Can be staggered in pitch and time
  - Augmentation = Speed varies
  - Invert = One goes up other goes down
  - Retrograde = Backwards = Crab Cannon
- *Isomorphism*: Information preserving transformation
- Fugue is like a canon but more creative is allowed

### An Endlessly Rising Canon
- *Strange Loop*: Moving upwards or downwards through a hierarchy ends at the same spot.

### Escher
- Graphic Artist: Based on paradoxillusion, or double meaning

### Godel
- Cretan: "All Cretans are liars"
- Epimenide's Paradox
- Tried to reason about math with math
- All consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory include undecidable propositions
- There are true statements (in PM) which can't be proved
- Provability < Truth
- No axiomatic system can represent the complexity of whole numbers

### Mathematical Logic: A Synopsis
- Geometry = Theory of properties of abstract points and lines
- Non-Euclidean Geometries
- Lots of progress to clarify what is meant by a "proof"
- Russel's Paradox
  - You have run-of-the-mill and self-swallowing sets.
  - Every set is either but not both
  - Consider R: The set of all run-of-the-mill sets
- Grelling's Paradox
  - Similar but with self-descriptive (autological) and non-self-descriptive (heterological) adjectives
  - Consider the word heterological

### Banishing Strange Loops
- Make sets hierarchical 
- Two sentences referencing each other are meaningless
- "In this book , I ..."
- Math v.s. Logic

### Consistency, Completeness, Hilbert's Program
- Hilbert called for completeness of P.M.
- Godel disproved this to be possible

### Babbages, Computers, AI ...
- Difference engine, analytical engine weaves algebraic patterns
- How to make computers intelligent?

### ... and Bach
- Materialism

# Chapter 1: The MU-puzzle
### Formal Systems
- MU Rules
  - xI --> xIU
  - Mx --> Mxx
  - III --> U
  - UU -->
- You cannot go from MI to MU b/c modular arithmetic

### Theorems, Axioms, and Rules
- Theorem = String producible by rules
- Axiom = Starting String(s)

### Inside and Outside the System
- Computers often unobservant whereas human can't help but observe.

### M/I/U Mode
- Mechanical
- Intellectual
- Un-mode

### Decision Procedures
- Tests that finish in finite time
