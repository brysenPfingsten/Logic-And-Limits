## I :: Introduction
*Axiomatic Method*: Discovered by the Greeks as a way to deductively prove geometry by accepting a set of axioms and deriving propositions.
    - If the axioms are proved true, the truth and consistency of the derived theorems are guaranteed to be true.
- Gödel showed that sectors of mathematics couldn't fully utilize the axiomatic method
    - Can't establish the consistency of many deductive systems unless your reasoning system is so complex that it itself may not be consistent
    - Cannot guarantee freedom from internal contradiction 

## II :: The Problem of Consistency
- Greeks did not see the parallel postulate as self evident b/c of asymptotic lines
    - 19th century folks showed it was impossible to prove
    - There can be a proof of the impossibility of proving certain propositions in a given system
- Mathematics is the best discipline for drawing conclusions from a given set of axioms
    - "Pure mathematics is the subject in which we do not know what we are talking about, or whether what we are saying is true"
- As mathematics became more formalized, certain terms became more general and widely used
- Intuition is not a safe guide. We are abandoning it
- If a set of statements is assumed true and good logic is used, there cannot be a mutual contradiction
- Consider elliptical geometry. It's "parallel" postulate is not self evident and we are less sure it is consistent
    - We can give the abstract postulates of a system a "model" and interpretation and see if it holds up

1. Any two members of K are contained in just one member of L
2. No member of K is contained in more than two members of L
3. The members of K are not all contained in a single member of L
4. Any two members of L contain just one member of K
5. No member of L contains more than two members of K
- You can think of K as the set of vertices on a triangle and L to be the lines

- Hilbert transformed geometry into algebra
    - The consistency of Euclid's postulates is established by showing that they are satisfied by an algebraic model
- How can we jump from finite observations to infinite conclusions?
- *Antinomie*: Real or apparent contradictions between two equally logical, reasonable, or well-founded conclusions.
- Russell's paradox shows intuition can be faulty
- Model method is valuable but does not solve our problem

## III :: Absolute Proofs of Consistency
- Hilbert proposes _absolute proofs_
    1. Complete formalization of a deductive system
        - Develop a "meaningless" calculus
        - The meaning we ascribe to these symbols do not belong to the system but instead a "meta-mathematics"
        - Expression: "2 + 3 = 5"
        - Statement: '2 + 3 = 5' is an arithmetical formula
    2. Achieves its objectives by using a minimum of principles of inference and not assuming the consistency of some other set of axioms
